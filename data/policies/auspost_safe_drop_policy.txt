# Australia Post – Safe Drop / Authority to Leave (ATL) — Compiled Notes (for prototype)

## What is Safe Drop / ATL
Allows a parcel to be left at the delivery address without signature when conditions are met.

## Conditions (must ALL hold)
- Sender has allowed Safe Drop/ATL for the service.
- Receiver has opted in (e.g., via MyPost or AusPost app) for Safe Drop for this parcel/address.
- The driver identifies a genuinely safe place: not visible from street and protected from weather.

## Exclusions (cannot be left)
- Items requiring ID/age verification (e.g., alcohol, restricted items).
- Items flagged by the sender as signature-only / no ATL.

## If there is NO safe place
- Parcel is taken to the nearest Post Office or collection point.
- A card or electronic notification is provided.

## Examples
- Intercom broken; customer at home: meet at entrance if feasible; otherwise Post Office collection.
- Apartment lobby with public access and no concealment: no safe place → Post Office collection.

## Notes
This file is a condensed policy brief for a student prototype, not official AusPost policy.
